# 🏞️ ParkWise AI

**ParkWise AI** is a beginner-friendly Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application that answers questions about U.S. National Parks using information retrieved from official park documents.

Instead of asking a language model to answer from general knowledge, ParkWise first searches its local document collection, retrieves the most relevant passages, and provides those passages to Gemini as context for a grounded response.

The project was built from scratch to demonstrate the core stages of a RAG pipeline without hiding the retrieval process behind a large RAG framework.

# 🧠 What is RAG?

Retrieval-Augmented Generation combines information retrieval with a Large Language Model.

Instead of sending only a user's question to the LLM, ParkWise first searches trusted documents for relevant information.

The retrieved text becomes additional context for the model.

```text
User Question
      ↓
Retrieve Relevant Information
      ↓
Provide Question + Context to LLM
      ↓
Generate Grounded Answer
```

This reduces the need for the model to rely entirely on its general training knowledge.

# 🔄 End-to-End RAG Pipeline

ParkWise follows these stages:

### 1. Document Loading

Official park PDF files are loaded using **PyMuPDF**.

Each extracted page keeps metadata such as:

```python
{
    "source": "redwood.pdf",
    "page": 2,
    "text": "..."
}
```

Keeping metadata allows ParkWise to show the user where retrieved information came from.

---

### 2. Chunking

Large PDF pages are divided into smaller pieces.

Current configuration:

```text
Chunk size: 250 words
Overlap: 50 words
```

Overlap helps prevent information from being lost when an important sentence appears near the boundary between two chunks.

---

### 3. Embeddings

Each chunk is converted into a numerical vector using:

```text
all-MiniLM-L6-v2
```

Each embedding contains:

```text
384 dimensions
```

Semantically similar pieces of text should have similar vector representations.

---

### 4. Query Processing

When a user asks a question, ParkWise performs several preprocessing steps.

For example:

```text
Can I bring my pets to Redwood Park?
```

ParkWise can detect:

```text
Target park → Redwood
Topic → pets
```

The query can also be expanded with related terms such as:

```text
pets
dogs
allowed
prohibited
leash
restrained
trails
```

This improves retrieval when the user's wording differs from the wording in the source document.

---

### 5. Semantic Retrieval

The user's question is converted into the same 384-dimensional embedding representation.

ParkWise compares the query vector against document vectors using normalized vector similarity.

The implementation currently uses **NumPy** for the similarity calculation.

---

### 6. Metadata Filtering

If the question clearly identifies a park, ParkWise filters unrelated park documents.

For example:

```text
Question:
Can I bring pets to Redwood Park?

                ↓

Search:
redwood.pdf

Not:
mount_rainier.pdf
rocky_mountain.pdf
```

This improves retrieval precision.

---

### 7. Keyword Boosting

Semantic similarity is combined with lightweight keyword matching.

This creates a simple hybrid retrieval strategy:

```text
Semantic Similarity
        +
Keyword Matching
        +
Park Metadata Filtering
        ↓
Ranked Results
```

---

### 8. Top-K Retrieval

ParkWise currently selects the top:

```text
5 chunks
```

These chunks become the evidence supplied to the language model.

---

### 9. Grounded Generation

The retrieved chunks and user question are sent to Gemini.

The prompt instructs the model to:

* answer only from the supplied document context
* avoid inventing information
* state when the documents do not contain enough information
* avoid fabricating sources or page numbers

---

### 10. Source Display

ParkWise displays source information alongside answers, including:

```text
🌿 Redwood National & State Parks
📄 Page 2
🎯 Retrieval relevance score
```

A developer debug mode can also display the complete retrieved chunks.

---

# 📚 Current Knowledge Base

ParkWise Version 1 currently uses documents for:

* 🌲 Redwood National & State Parks
* 🌋 Mount Rainier National Park
* 🏔️ Rocky Mountain National Park

The documents were collected from official National Park Service sources.

# ⚙️ Local Installation

## 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repository>
cd parkwise-rag
```

## 2. Create a Virtual Environment

Windows:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

macOS/Linux:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

## 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 4. Configure the Gemini API Key

Create:

```text
.env
```

Add:

```text
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Never commit this file to GitHub.

## 5. Start ParkWise

```bash
python -m streamlit run app.py
```

Then open the local Streamlit address shown in the terminal.

---

# 🔐 Security

ParkWise keeps the Gemini API key outside the source code.

Local development uses:

```text
.env
```

The `.env` file is excluded through `.gitignore`.

Production deployments should use the hosting platform's secret-management system rather than storing API keys in the repository.

If an API key is ever accidentally committed to a public repository, the key should be revoked or rotated immediately.

---

# ☁️ Deployment

The application is designed for Streamlit Community Cloud.

Deployment requires:

```text
app.py
requirements.txt
data/
src/
```

The Gemini API key must be added through Streamlit's deployment secrets rather than committed to GitHub.

Example secret:

```toml
GEMINI_API_KEY = "your_api_key_here"
```

The app accesses the value through:

```python
os.getenv("GEMINI_API_KEY")
```

---

# 🧪 Example Questions

Try asking:

```text
Can I bring my pets to Redwood Park?
```

```text
What wildlife can I see in Redwood?
```

```text
What should I know about hiking safety in Rocky Mountain National Park?
```

```text
Where can I camp in Mount Rainier National Park?
```

---

# 🔍 Retrieval Debugging

ParkWise includes an optional developer mode.

When enabled, it displays:

* retrieved document
* page number
* chunk ID
* relevance score
* full retrieved text

This makes it possible to determine whether an incorrect answer was caused by:

```text
Poor Retrieval
      ↓
Retriever problem
```

or:

```text
Correct Retrieval
      +
Poor Generated Answer
      ↓
Generation/prompt problem
```

---

# ⚠️ Current Limitations

ParkWise Version 1 intentionally remains small and understandable.

Current limitations include:

* only three parks
* small document collection
* embeddings are recreated when the application initializes
* no persistent vector database
* lightweight keyword boosting rather than a full search engine
* no reranking model
* no automated RAG evaluation suite
* responses depend on external Gemini API availability

---

# 🚀 Future Improvements

Possible Version 2 improvements include:

* FAISS or Qdrant vector storage
* persistent precomputed embeddings
* additional National Park documents
* document upload support
* advanced metadata filtering
* automatic park/entity detection
* BM25 + semantic hybrid search
* reranking
* retrieval evaluation
* citation-level evidence highlighting
* conversational query rewriting
* automated tests
* RAG quality metrics
* agentic retrieval tools

---
